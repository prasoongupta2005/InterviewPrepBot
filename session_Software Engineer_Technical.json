        "Imagine you're working on a high-throughput e-commerce platform.  Describe how you would design a system to track real-time inventory updates across multiple warehouses and ensure consistency when processing a large volume of concurrent orders.",
        "Imagine you're working on a highly scalable e-commerce platform.  Describe a system design for a product recommendation service that can handle millions of users and products, while providing personalized recommendations in real-time with low latency. Consider data storage, retrieval, processing, and the algorithms you might use.  What trade-offs would you make in terms of accuracy, performance, and cost?",
        "Let's say we have a system where users can upload videos.  These videos need to be processed asynchronously after upload:  transcoded into multiple resolutions, thumbnails generated, metadata extracted, etc. Design a system to handle this asynchronous processing, considering factors like scalability, fault tolerance, and monitoring.  Don't worry about specific technologies, focus on the overall architecture and components involved."

        "**Overall Feedback:**\n\nThis answer is extremely poor.  It lacks any substance and demonstrates a lack of engagement and communication skills.  \"Yes sir\" (or \"Yes ma'am\") might be appropriate in some very limited military or formal contexts, but is generally inappropriate in a technical interview.  It doesn't address the question, provide any insight into the candidate's thinking, or offer any information about their abilities.\n\n**Specific Areas to Improve:**\n\n* **Content:**  The answer provides no content whatsoever.  The candidate needs to actually answer the question being asked. This includes explaining their reasoning, thought process, and approach to the problem.\n* **Communication:**  Even if the candidate knew the answer immediately, they should articulate their solution and explain how they arrived at it.  Effective communication is crucial for software engineers.\n* **Professionalism:** While politeness is important, \"yes sir\" comes across as overly formal and even subservient in a modern tech interview setting.  A simple \"yes\" or \"yes, I understand the question\" followed by the actual answer would be more appropriate.\n* **Technical Depth:**  This response provides no evidence of technical understanding or problem-solving ability.\n\n**Score out of 10:**\n\n1/10. This answer demonstrates a fundamental inability to engage with the interview process effectively.  The only reason it's not a 0 is because at least the candidate acknowledged the question.  It's highly unlikely a candidate giving this response would move forward in the interview process.",
        "This answer is extremely poor. It shows a lack of engagement and professionalism.  It provides no information about the candidate's understanding or ability to solve the problem posed in the interview.\n\n* **Clarity:** Extremely poor. The answer is unclear and provides no context.\n* **Correctness:** Not applicable, as no solution or approach is presented.\n* **Completeness:** Extremely poor.  The answer is completely incomplete.\n* **Technical Accuracy and Problem-Solving Approach:** Not applicable, as no technical details are provided.\n\n\n**Overall Feedback:** This response is unacceptable in a technical interview. The candidate needs to actively engage with the question, demonstrate their problem-solving skills, and articulate their thought process clearly.  \"ok sir\" suggests a passive and potentially disengaged attitude.\n\n**Specific Areas to Improve:**\n\n* **Active Listening and Engagement:**  The candidate needs to demonstrate that they have understood the question by rephrasing it or asking clarifying questions if needed.\n* **Communication:** The candidate must clearly articulate their thought process, explaining their approach and reasoning behind their chosen solution.  This includes verbalizing the steps they're taking, even if they're working through the problem on a whiteboard or in a code editor.\n* **Technical Depth:**  Depending on the question, the candidate needs to showcase their technical knowledge and skills relevant to the problem. This may involve discussing algorithms, data structures, design patterns, or other technical concepts.\n* **Professionalism:**  Addressing the interviewer appropriately and respectfully is crucial. While \"sir\" might be appropriate in some cultures, a more generally acceptable approach is to use the interviewer's name or simply \"yes\" or \"okay.\"  More importantly, the candidate needs to demonstrate enthusiasm and interest in the problem and the position.\n\n**Score out of 10:** 0/10. This answer deserves a zero because it fails to address the question in any meaningful way. It signals a lack of preparation and potentially a lack of interest in the position.  Even a flawed attempt at a solution would be preferable to this response.",
        "This answer is extremely poor for a technical interview, especially for a backend software engineer position.  It lacks any substance and demonstrates a lack of engagement and professionalism.\n\n* **Clarity:**  Very poor. \"Fine sir\" doesn't convey any information about the candidate's understanding or approach to the question.\n* **Correctness:**  Cannot be assessed.  There's nothing to evaluate for correctness as no solution or attempt was provided.\n* **Completeness:**  Completely incomplete.  The candidate provided no answer to the actual question.\n* **Technical Accuracy and Problem-Solving Approach:**  Cannot be assessed. No technical details or problem-solving approach were demonstrated.\n\n**Overall Feedback:** This response is unacceptable in a technical interview.  It suggests disinterest, lack of preparation, or potentially even a misunderstanding of the question.  The candidate needs to provide a substantial answer demonstrating their technical skills and problem-solving abilities.\n\n**Specific Areas to Improve:**\n\n* **Engage with the question:** Provide a thoughtful and detailed response, even if unsure of the perfect solution.  Verbalize the thought process.\n* **Demonstrate understanding:**  Start by restating the question to confirm understanding.  If unsure, ask clarifying questions.\n* **Provide a solution (or attempt):**  Even a partial or imperfect solution is better than no answer. Explain the reasoning behind the chosen approach.\n* **Professionalism:**  Use professional language.  \"Fine sir\" is overly formal and can be perceived as sarcastic in this context.\n\n**Score:** 1/10 (1 point only for acknowledging the interviewer, though the formality is inappropriate)"
